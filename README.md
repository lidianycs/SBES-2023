# SBES-2023

This repository contains the supplementary material of the paper **A Thematic Synthesis on Empathy in Software Engineering based on the Practitioners' Perspective** published in the Research Track of the 
XXXVII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2023). To download the paper, access [https://doi.org/10.1145/3613372.3613407](https://doi.org/10.1145/3613372.3613407).

The artifacts are a result of a thematic synthesis of grey literature performed to investigate the meaning, importance, practices, and effects of empathy from the perspective of software practitioners. 
The analysis was based on web articles from DEV, an online community used by software developers. 
The data was collected and stored in the repository to preserve the evidence and ensure the studyâ€™s replicability.
